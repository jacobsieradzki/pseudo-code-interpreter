# Pseudo Code Interpreter
My A Level Computer Science coursework - a pseudo code interpreter for iPad.

This application is supposed to be used as an aid to GCSE students sitting an OCR GCSE Computer Science examination. There are many questions throughout the exams using a strict syntax of pseudocode where the students are expected to read, understand, write and trace algorithms written in this syntax of pseudo code. 

The pseudo code guide syntax from OCR can be found [here](www.ocr.org.uk/Images/202653-pseudocode-guide.pdf).

## The App

My app has an editor, a console and a code library. On the left, the user types in their pseudo code. The user clisk CHECK where they are asked to input any inputs that are required throughout the program. If the program is valid, they will be able to press the PLAY button, which will run the program and print the output to the console on the right. The user can either run the program all at once, or run it line by line. They can also save code snippets to the code library.
